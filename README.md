this is one of my first games ever so it's very embarassing but also exciting lol

it's a game where you have a tiny garden in your house where you can grow a wide variety of vegetables,
then you can sell them raw or cook them into many recipes, and sell for more profit!
future features include a restaurant and multiplayer assets!
